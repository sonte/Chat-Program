Chat-Program
============

Welcom to my first node.js experiment.  I made a chat program that kind of mimics IRC.  You can create any room you want to 
chat in, and only those people in that room can chat with you.  Also you cannot use the same name as someone already in the 
chat room.  The files listed here are the ones that I created.  Below is a list of additional files on the node.js and 
javascript side that you will need to make this work.


node.js

mongodb
socket.io

Javascript

jquery
jquear.tinysort
